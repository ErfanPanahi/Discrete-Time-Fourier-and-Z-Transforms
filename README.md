# Discrete-Time-Fourier-and-Z-Transforms
In this repository, I delve into examining the properties of the Z-transform and discrete Fourier transform, along with various applications of these two transforms.

The completed sections of the project are as follows:

**1- Simulation of Signal Processing Blocks**

In this section, DTFT blocks, Compressor, Expander, and Interpolator have been implemented.
It's worth mentioning that the Interpolator block has three different modes, which are as follows: ideal interpolation, linear interpolation, and cubic spline interpolation.

**2- Adaptive Sampling Rate System**

**3- Fourier Transform Analysis**

**4- Frequency divider construction**

**5- Phase Identification**

There is a common belief that the human ear cannot perceive phase differences. This means it cannot distinguish between two signals with different phases. We want to test this hypothesis. For this purpose, we design an LTI system that does not change the input magnitude but introduces a phase shift to it. Generally, such systems are referred to as all-pass systems.

**6- Solving a differential equation**
